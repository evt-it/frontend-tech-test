# frontend-tech-test

## Task

Build a SPA using ReactJS that does the following:

- display a list of heroes' names
- have a search box on top of the page - enter a keyword it will be matched against all data relevant to the hero and only matched names will show up - remove the keyword all names should show up
- click on a name will go to sub page `/<hero name>`, and will display the hero's bio and a list of their nemesis - this time the search box on top will only match on the nemesis
- click on a nemesis's name will go to sub page `/<hero name>/nemesis/<nemesis-name>`, and will display the nemesis's bio - this time the search box shall disappear
- display a breadcrumb at the top of the page so we can easily navigate back to the previous 2 pages

### Key Points

- Single page app with working path (e.g. `/spider-man/` will only show the Spider-man page)
- Unit test for search function (choose your own test framework)
- Prepare a readme to explain how to build/run/test the app
